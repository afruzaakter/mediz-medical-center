                                Authorization determines what resources a user can access.It works through settings that are implemented and maintained by the organization and always takes place after authentication.
                                Authorization isnâ€™t visible to or changeable by the user.

                                <span className='title fs-4 '>Authentication:</span>
                                Authentication verifies who the user is.It works through passwords, one-time pins, biometric information, and other information provided or entered by the user.Authentication is the first step of a good identity and access management process and is visible to and partially changeable by the user.
